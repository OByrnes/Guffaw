<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Small comedy events have a hard time finding audiences. Its hard to promote their shows. They often don't have their own websites. Guffaw helps them showcase themselves and allows users to discover new talent in their area and shows to go to.

Here's why:
* Comedians can upload their information and events.
* Hosts of shows can promote them as well as find new comics to add to upcoming Shows
* Fans can find all the shows in their area based on what kinds of comedy they like or the comedians they enjoy.
